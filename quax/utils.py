    """
    Simulates the Faa Di Bruno formula, giving a set of partial derivative operators which are required
    to find a particular higher order partial derivative operator, as defined by `deriv_order` and `address`.

    The returned partial derivative operators are each represented by vectors of length NCART where NCART is 3 * natom.
    The value of each index in these vectors describes how many times to differentiate wrt that particular cartesian coordinate.
    For example, a 2 atom system has atoms A,B and all derivative vectors have indices which correspond to the coordinates: [Ax, Ay, Az, Bx, By, Bz].
    A derivative vector [1,0,0,2,0,0] therefore represents the partial derivative (d^3)/(dAx dBx dBx).

    Parameters
    ----------
    natoms : int
        The number of atoms in the system. The cartesian nuclear derivative tensor for this `natom` system
        has a dimension size 3 * natom
    deriv_order : int
        The order of differentiation.  The cartesian nuclear derivative tensor for this `natom` system
        has rank `deriv_order` and dimension size 3 * natoms
    address : tuple of int
        A tuple of integers which describe which cartesian partial derivative
        we wish to compute. Each integer in the tuple is in the range [0, NCART-1]
    Returns
    -------
    partial_derivatives : arr
        An array of partial derivatives of dimensions (npartials, NCART)
